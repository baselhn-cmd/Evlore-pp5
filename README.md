## Wireframes
I used Balsamiq to create [wireframes](https://moqups.com/) for my project. It's a user-friendly wireframing tool that enables me to quickly and easily create mockups for my website or application. It offers a wide range of pre-built UI elements, and allows for easy collaboration with my team. I linked a pdf of my wireframes, which you can access it and check it out the design, layout and the flow of the project before implementing it in the real product.

## AWS 

I am using AWS S3 buckets to store my data. S3 is a highly scalable and durable cloud storage service provided by Amazon Web Services. It allows me to easily store and retrieve large amounts of data, and its built-in security features provide added protection for my files. I chose S3 for its scalability, durability, and security features.

# Validation  

## HTML Validation

The HTML code for the project was validated using the [W3C HTML Validator.](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) All pages passed without errors except for the shopping cart page. The issue arose with the remove product link, which resulted in a duplicated ID error. This occurred because the ID changes dynamically based on the product ID, making it challenging to fix before the deadline.

## Bugs
**Bug:** You can change the html file in product detail and change the maximun number of product to add in cart. It will cause an 500 server error in checkout because it's only allowed to add a maximun of 99 of a product.  
**Fix:** I need to fix this but for now there is left like this because I don't have the time to solve it, but I know it's there.

**Bug:** I had some problem with main nav and mobile-nav includes. There where a duplication of an ID in the search dropdown.  
**Fix:** Solve this by removed the ID from the base and gave it an uniqe ID so there was no duplication that gave problem.

**Bug:** When user had add a review there was an delete option on every review, even if the user had not write it by themself.  
**Fix:** Add a if statement with the request user and it solved it.

**Bug:** When a user had add a product to wishlist, there was shown a filled star at the product page on that product. Adn empty stars at the other product. But if a user added more products to wishlist, there added a star, so if the user had ad three product threr where shown three stars in product page beside the product name.  
**Fix:** I had an else statement that ruined it. When i removed the else statement there was only one filled star that showed on the products that the user had added. And on the rest of the product there is no star at all.   

## Deployment
To deploy my project, I had to use the Code Institute Python Essentials Template with all the neccesserely code for this project to work woth Django. With that template I create a repository in Github where i start my project.
And then open it and work with it at Gitpod workspaces.
It is important to open the same workspace everytime you have to work with it and to do that and secure it's being saved, you have to pin it in your workspace dashboard at gitpod.
When you want to save your work you need to write the commands in the terminal of your workspace: ***git add .*** , ***git commit -m "commit message"*** and then push it to github with ***git push***. To publish it and store it in your Github repositry.

* Then i want to deploy it at heroku, I am using my account on Heroku, if you doesnt have an account you will register first before deploying and then create a project in heroku. 
* Create a Procfile in your project, this required that specifies the commands that are executed by the app on startup.

  * Click the New dropdown and select Create New App.
  * Create a name to your project and it has to be uniqe.
  * Select the region you are working in, in my case Europe
  * Heroku Settings You will need to set your Environment Variables and this is importat to ensure your application is deployed properly.
  * In settings click "Reveal Config Vars" and set the variables that you need. Like the secret keys for stripe and aws in my case and a development key for deploy when i am working with the project.
  * connect your github repository with your heroku project in settings and connect with github.
  * Deploy your branch automatic or manually. At first the automatic deployment creats every time you push your code to github. But in the middle of the project heroku change the way and you had to save it via the heroku CLI and i was using the terminal to push it to heroku. with this steps:
  1. Write heroku login -i in terminal on your workspace.
  2. add your email and then password to heroku 
  3. Write heroku apps, to get all of your heroku apps
  4. Write heroku git:remote -a < appname >
  5. the gut add . , git commit -m "message", git push origin main.
  5. and the last step is "git push heroku main"

After this you have create a workspace and deployed your project to github and heroku!
