Adding a custom 404 page
For your e-commerce applications project, you will need to add a custom 404 page, which displays when a user tries to access a URL that does not exist in your application.

To add a custom 404 page to the completed Boutique Ado walkthrough project, please follow the steps below.

Your finished 404 page will look like this:

A screenshot of the Boutique Ado 404 page

Create your 404 handler function
In the app: boutique_ado, create a new file called views.py
Inside the views.py file, first import the render function from django.shortcuts
from django.shortcuts import render
In the same file, paste in the code below to create your 404 page handler:
def handler404(request, exception):
    """ Error Handler 404 - Page Not Found """
    return render(request, "errors/404.html", status=404)

This function will load an HTML file called 404.html whenever a user tries to access a URL that does not exist. (You will create the 404.html file soon).

Configure your handler URL
Open the urls.py file in the boutique_ado app
At the top of the file, import the handler404 handler function from the views file:
from .views import handler404
At the very bottom of the file, after the very last line, create a variable called handler404 and set it to a string that indicates the location of the 404 handler function you created in the views file:
handler404 = 'boutique_ado.views.handler404'

Django knows to automatically look for this handler404 variable and uses it to find and call the handler404 function when a user tries to navigate to a URL that does not exist.

Create your 404.html file
In the main templates/ directory, create a folder called: errors
Inside the errors folder, create a file called 404.html
The 404.html template code:
{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% load static %}
{% block content %}
    <div class="container header-container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col"></div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container h-100">
        <div class="row h-100">
            <div class="col-7 col-md-6 my-auto">
                <h1 class="display-4 logo-font text-black">
                    The page you are looking for isn't available
                </h1>
                <div class="my-5">
                    <h4>
                        <a href="{% url 'products' %}" 
                            class="shop-now-button btn btn-lg rounded-0 text-uppercase py-3">
                                Return to shop
                        </a>
                    </h4>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
{% endblock %}

Test your error page works:
Commit all your changes and push them to the deployed version of your application on Heroku.
Load your deployed application on Heroku.
Change the URL to any broken URL path. For example: /test
NOTE: You will not be able to test your custom 404 page on a local hosted version because of the way it is set up.

For more information, please consult the Django 3.2 documentation on the 404 exception as well as customising and testing other error views.
