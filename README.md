## AWS 

I am using AWS S3 buckets to store my data. S3 is a highly scalable and durable cloud storage service provided by Amazon Web Services. It allows me to easily store and retrieve large amounts of data, and its built-in security features provide added protection for my files. I chose S3 for its scalability, durability, and security features.



## Database

I built my database using PostgreSQL. It's a powerful and open-source object-relational database system that is known for its reliability, robustness, and performance. I chose it because it provides a flexible tool for efficiently managing and organizing my data.
